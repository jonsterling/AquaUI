# What is AquaUI?

AquaUI is a love letter to the Macintosh of the Aqua era—with its uncompromising attention to detail, futuristic design, and “lickable” visual style.


# What are our goals?

The goal is not necessarily to recreate 2000s-era Aqua visuals pixel by pixel: instead, we aim to imagine how the Aqua design language could have evolved if it had been allowed to do so.

We also aim for AquaUI applications to be good citizens within present-day macOS:

1. We deviate from present-day macOS behaviors mainly when they represent a usability regression.

2. We aim to support both accent colors and light/dark mode.


# How can I contribute?

Contributions are extremely welcome. You will find that current implementations have various limitations, and we very sincerely hope that contributors will feel free to lift these limitations.

Visual design is a matter of both taste *and* ability. Contributions that improve the visual design in line with the project vision are welcome.

# Can I use AquaUI in my application?

AquaUI is [licensed permissively](LICENSE), because we want it to be a widely usable as possible.
